# Data-Science
Data Structures are a way of organizing data in a specialized format on a computer. This repository contains files of code illustrating how tuples and stacks are implemented in Python. 

## Tuple
The Python file contains lines of code showing how to create a tuple, add items to a tuple, change items in a tuple, and remove items from a tuple.
A tuple is a data structure used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
It is mutable and allows duplicate values.
Values in a tuple can be of any data type.
Elements in a tuple are separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.

## Stacks
The Python file contains lines of code showing how to create a stack, add items to a stack, remove items from a stack, and get the size of a stack.
A stack is a data structure that follows a particular order of operations, which is LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)
Inserted last comes out first, inserted first comes out last.

## Queue
The Python file contains lines of code showing how the queue is implemented in the Python programming language. How to create a queue, add items to the queue, remove items from the queue, access items and access the front and back elements.
Queue is a  data structure that stores elements sequentially.
It uses the FIFO(First In First Out) principle of accessing elements, meaning that it is open at both ends.
Inserting is done at one end, the rear end or tail while deletion is done at the front end.
