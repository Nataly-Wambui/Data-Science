# Data-Science
Data Structures are a way of organizing data in a specialized format on a computer. This repository contains files of code illustrating how tuples and stacks are implemented in Python. 

## Tuple
The Python file contains lines of code showing how to create a tuple, add items to a tuple, change items in a tuple, and remove items from a tuple.
A tuple is a data structure used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
It is mutable and allows duplicate values.
Values in a tuple can be of any data type.
Elements in a tuple are separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.

## Stacks
The Python file contains lines of code showing how to create a stack, add items to a stack, remove items from a stack, and get the size of a stack.
A stack is a data structure that follows a particular order of operations, which is LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)
Inserted last comes out first, inserted first comes out last.
